203_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated if the orientation of the tool of the monitored kinematic system is outside the permissible range.
203_LongDesc=This AMF is violated if the orientation of the tool of the monitored kinematic system is outside the permissible range. The permissible range is defined by a workspace around a reference vector in the world coordinate system. The reference vector is specified by the rotation of the Z unit vector about the ZYX Euler angles A, B, C.

205_ShortDesc=The AMF is violated if the configured component of the external force acting on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
205_LongDesc=The AMF is violated if the configured component of the external force acting on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. The configured component is relative to a reference frame defined by rotation of the base frame by the ZYX Euler angles A, B, C.
