203_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the tool orientation of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
203_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the tool orientation of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. The permitted area is defined by the operating angle and the reference vector in the world coordinate system.

205_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the configured component of the external force exerted on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. The configured component is relative to a reference frame, which results from the rotating the base frame by the ZYX-Eulerangles A, B, C.
